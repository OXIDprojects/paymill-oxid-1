The same code can be found on MasterCard credit cards - where however it is called CVC. CVC is an abbreviation for &quot;Card Validation Code&quot;. CVV code on the other hand is an abbreviation for &quot;Card Validation Value code&quot;. Similar to MasterCard and Visa, other brands such as Diners Club, Discover and JCB contain a three digit number that can usually be found on the back of the credit card. MAESTRO cards exist with and without a three digit CVV. In case a MAESTRO card without a CVV will be used, it is possible to enter 000 to the form instead. American Express uses the CID (card identification number). The CID is a four digit number that can usually be found on the front of the card, top right from the credit card number. ",
